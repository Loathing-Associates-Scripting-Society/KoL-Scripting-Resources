# Introduction
## Why script KOL?
Define the goals of KOL scripting with examples of what you can do with scripts (automate ascensions, automate farming, bring up resources, etc; absolute base-level things, to explain what the underlying reasoning is behind scripting. We could even include a snippet of my old farming spreadsheet where I tried to calculate how much time it took to do barf farming in the years I did it manually before I scripted it, maybe?)

## What are the tools available for scripting KoL?
Things this should contain:
- very basic summary of ASH/TS
- Link to VSCode
- Link to Mafia Wiki

# ASH & Javascript
Start with a two-bullet comparison simply describing each language. Something like:

- ASH is a specific-use KoL language that was built by KoLMafia's developers, starting with Mafia's inception in 2010 (?) and being improved and maintained since.
- Javascript is a fundamental programming language used across the internet, primarily for backend webpage functionality and is supported for code execution in all major browsers.

Then, a table with some short 1-liners of how you'd accomplish things in one versus the other. 

| Syntax | ASH | Javascript |
|---------|------|---|
| Look up an item | - | - |
| Restore MP | - | - |
| Buy a Big Rock | - | - |
| Kmail Gausie a Holiday Fun | - | - |

## ASH
### Common ASH functions and their uses
Here we'd describe basic ASH use cases and link a few of the better primers in the mafia wiki.

### Examples of High-Level ASH Code
This would probably just be a link to Dictator's pastebin and then "lol" 

### The Pros and Cons of ASH
Bulleted list in a table outlining good/bad of ASH as a language.

## Javascript

### Why Javascript?

### Improving your JS development with Typescript

### Linting and Libram
