# Scripting Community Service
## Introduction

[Community Service](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Community_Service) (CS) has become a commonly scripted challenge path due to its simplicity and speed (both in-game and real-time). Rather than need to perform all of the standard council quests, the player gets 11 tasks that take a single button click each. Said tasks can be accelerated by buffing up things like stats, familiar weight or item drops. It doesn't take a lot of shiny to do a two-day run, and sufficiently loaded accounts can perform replicable one-day ascensions with low turn counts and organ use. This is desirable as it allows for a second shot at valuable once per day item generation, as well as extra aftercore turns for farming or event participation.

Unfortunately, it's not easy to create a one-size-fits-all high-end CS solution due to a lot of moving parts. The path rewards access to a lot of old shinies, but it's possible to get creative and plus holes in your setup in various unconventional ways. Once you have an operational CS run plan, it's not that hard to precisely execute it. Scripting can assist with consistency, doing anything from buffing you up so you don't forget some effect all the way to performing a whole run for you.

## Creating a Run Plan

A typical CS ascension consists of the following stages:
- Doing coil wire, the 60-turn task that can't be accelerated
- Using the resulting reward to kick-start your stats, and levelling up as quickly as possible to help with the stat tests
- Performing the stat tests, and then all other tests:
    - It's common to group hot resistance, noncombat and familiar weight together as they all benefit from having a heavy familiar - [exotic parrot](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Exotic_Parrot) helps with hot resistance, while [disgeist](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Disgeist_(familiar)) helps with noncombat
    - A number of buffs are shared between weapon damage and spell damage
    - Doing the item test last allows the item buffs used to carry over into aftercore, and if you have the [emotion chip](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Emotionally_Chipped) then you can use [Feeling Lost](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Feeling_Lost) for an additional +60% on the test; one of your first post-run actions should be to remove the effect due to its built-in Teleportitis

Levelling is one of the more individualised portions of the run. The general idea is to use free fights with scaling monsters, derived from various IotMs like the [Neverending Party](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Neverending_Party). The more free fights you have the better, and access to the garbage tote doubles their efficiency. The higher you can pump your main stat and your experience gains from fights the better, which makes [Sweet Synthesis](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Sweet_Synthesis) with its +300% stat and +50% experience gain buffs a very desirable skill to have access to. However, as mentioned, it is possible to use replacement shinies to achieve these goals. For example, one can use the [diabolic pizza](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Diabolic_pizza) to get a [+500% buff](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Mallowed_Out) to all stats, which helps both with levelling and the subsequent tests. Another option is to use copies from the backup camera or pocket professor to get extra free scaling monster fights.

The non-stat tests are pretty much just a check list. Captain Scotch created a [very helpful sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CooctXongsf2nt1JmR8G-Qm_Dhs4V6oHDO04hLRCI_s/edit#gid=1299653939) listing the various buffs that can be used to accelerate the tests. Make a copy of the sheet and filter the lists to what you have access to. [Bow-Legged Swagger](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Bow-Legged_Swagger_(effect)) and [Steely-Eyed Squint](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Steely-Eyed_Squint_(effect)) save a lot of turns. The [Fourth of May Cosplay Saber](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Fourth_of_May_Cosplay_Saber) with its wonky combat-ending mechanic allows you to carry out buffs like [Meteor Showered](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Meteor_Showered) that were not meant to leave combat. But other than that there aren't any crazy turn saves, it's more about how much quantity you can put together. Remember that not every test needs to be capped, and familiar weight and spell damage in particular are likely to take a long time.

Another aspect of planning a run are softcore pulls. These can be used to cut turns from tests, or compensate for lacking certain IotM. For example, it's a good idea to pull [borrowed time](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Borrowed_time) to help with generating turns for coil wire if not in possession of [Clip Art](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Summon_Clip_Art).

If in need of assistance, ask in `#community-service` in the ASS discord. Be prepared with your [snapshot](http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/vb/showthread.php?t=218735), as it allows for better theorycrafting of a levelling plan or whatever else you may need help with. The folks there are very helpful - the author went from an AFK farmer to creating his own CS script in the space of a couple months.
